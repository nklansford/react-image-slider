If you want an introduction to React using this simple component, see my [React Image Slider Tutorial](https://github.com/nklansford/React-Image-Slider-Tutorial/tree/master)

The target audience are Cedarville Web Students who have taken Web 1 & 2, and Scripting for Interactivity.

If this is not you, some helpful things to be familiar with are:
- HTML
- CSS
- SASS
- JavaScript

Even if you don't know these elements, feel free to give it a try! You should still be able to get through the project since all of the code is provided. You may just need to spend more time on it!
